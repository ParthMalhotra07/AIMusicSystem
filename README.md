🎵 Tag-Free AI Music Recommendation System

This project builds an AI-powered music recommendation system that understands music directly from audio, without using genres, tags, or metadata. Songs are converted into numerical representations using signal-based features and embedded into a learned similarity space. User preferences are modeled from listening behavior within this space, enabling personalized and explainable recommendations.

The system supports cold-start users, works with unlabeled music, and provides transparent explanations based on musical properties like rhythm and timbre. By removing dependence on manual labels, the solution enables fairer music discovery and scalable recommendation for any audio collection.
